        <p> Our mission is very simple.</p>
        <p>
          We aim at helping individuals who find it difficult in finding a fun
          time partner, and to help those whose job is to service others,
          connect with their customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this, we will help a lot of persons quit the habit of self
          pleasuring and hopefully reduce rapists and peodophiles.
        </p>
